# JS Technology Evaluator

## Introduction

This is a test application that I wrote for evaluating up-and-coming JavaScript that I'm interested in. 

## Currently Using Technologies

* React Native Web
* CSS Modules
* TypeScript
* Parcel
* Babel 7

## TODOs
* ``npm audit`` is currently returning with two vulnerabilities for the version of React Native required by React Native
Web. Which is annoying...
